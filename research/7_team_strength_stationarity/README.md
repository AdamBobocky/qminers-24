Team strength seems to be trending -> i.e. good teams are mostly good, bad are mostly bad.
But it does change from season to season.

As a proxy to team strength I've used odds, transformed to be implied probability and ran
through inverse sigmoid to get a pseudo - logistic regression weights for their strength.

`charting.py` contains interactive plotly charts of team strengths across season.
Very useful and I didn't draw any conclusions from it yet.
