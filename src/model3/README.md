# Model2 but player-level

New features:
* Estimate player minutes based on the teams past 5 games the teams has played
* Model player skill based on research/16_player_skill_lr

The current results are this is not working. The backtest makes miniscule amount of money in best configuration, otherwise it loses various small amounts. This is a bad implementation of the information interpretation, but it can be done better.
