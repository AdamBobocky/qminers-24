# Analyze optimal betting strategy

## Simulate optimal log-wealth betting strategy

`boostrap_optimizer.py` does that

## Simulate optimal betting strategy in a simulated tournament environment

`main.py` does that

The idea is to use the training dataset to generate "possible subset of betting opportunities", and simulate what placement could different strategies yield given there are 19 other teams which have weaker models but can have varying risk apetites.
These different models should not be fully correlated with each other.
